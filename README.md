## Description

I started my site by creating a header with my name, as well as 3 links that direct you to the associated content on my page.

I then have created 3 different sections: About Me, Work, and Contact Me.

The about me will contain information about myself.

The work section contains links to one work item and will contain more as I continue to update this.

The contact me section contains my phone number, email, and github profile.

Finally I have created a footer that shows that I made the site.
