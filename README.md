## Description

I have created a site that contains an About Me, Work, Education, and Contact Me.

I have updated the html with the Bulma stylesheet to help make it mobile compatible and apply more styling.

All links at the top connect to the corresponding sections on the page.

In the "work" section, I have incorporated screenshots of my project and each box links directly to the appropriate page.

I have also updated the contact links to include my linkedin and added some icons.

The page also contains my resume and a link to my updated github.
